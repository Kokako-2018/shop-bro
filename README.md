# shop-bro

This is ShopBro 1.0.  My first attempt at creating shopbro as a part of my personal project.
It was later successfully pitched as a final project and brought to life with a team of 6 (ShopBro2.0).

This was built using React only (we weren't taught to use Redux yet) and I purposefully didnt'use a database as I wanted the app to be usable for anyone at any time but with no data being captured to protect users. The data was being kept in state and cleared when the browser was refreshed.

Not a fully functional app yet but was functional enough for me to conceptualise how the app would work before being taught Redux.
A great piece to learn and have fun with.
